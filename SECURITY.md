## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities (or anything that looks like one). Public issues can accidentally turn into public disclosure before it’s been understood or fixed.

Instead, report security concerns via email:

- Email: [Contact@cgfixit.com](mailto:Contact@cgfixit.com)
- Subject suggestion: `SECURITY: <short description>`

When reporting, include:
- What you found (clear description)
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept is fine)
- Impact (what can be read/modified/executed)
- Any relevant environment details (OS, compiler, etc.)

Please do not include real secrets, real credentials, or private data in your report.

### Response Expectations

This is a legacy / educational repo, so security reports are handled on a **best-effort** basis with no guaranteed timeline or fix. If a report is clearly valid and low-effort to address, it may be patched; otherwise it may be documented as a known limitation.
